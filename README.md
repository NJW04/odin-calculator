# odin-calculator
A working calculator with working and interactive UI.
However this calculator operates differently, as it does not take into account BEDMAS. So it will sequentially go through the entered equation, using the answer from the first sum, as the starting point for the next sum. 
E.g. 2 + 8 รท 2 = 5 rather than 6 because it went, 2 + 8 = 10 first, then went 10 รท 2 = 5.
